# TLD-TABL-Block
Prevent emails containing URLs with abused TLDs with Tenant Allow Block List

Microsoft Documentation describing TLD blocking:  
https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/microsoft-365/security/office-365-security/tenant-allow-block-list-urls-configure?view=o365-worldwide#scenario-top-level-domain-blocking?WT.mc_id=MVP_473477

# Sender Domains  

After releasing this repo I decided to add functionality to block sender domains too in TABL

Currently these include:
- OnionMail
- CockLi
- Temp Email Addresses (list heavily based of https://github.com/disposable/disposable)

> This will **ONLY** block the Sender Domain and not emails containing URL, however I leave this to the viewer you'd just need to copy the functionality from the TLD TABL Url Script.

The Temp Email list is large, I would **only** recommend deploying this if you have Defender for Office P2 as it exceeds the limit for plan 1.  

"Defender for Office 365 Plan 2: The maximum number of allow entries is 5000, and the maximum number of block entries is 10000 (15000 domain and email address entries in total)."

# Exchange Transport Rule For Senders Example - Modify as appropriate
> TLDs are now supported for Domain Senders in TABL so I would recommend using that instead and not using the Exchange Transport for anything other than auditing Ref :https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/defender-office-365/tenant-allow-block-list-email-spoof-configure#what-do-you-need-to-know-before-you-begin <img width="1082" height="117" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/750265ec-76f0-418a-9060-c52f2d5b1821" />
